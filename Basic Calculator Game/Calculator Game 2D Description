Creating a basic calculator game in Unity involves a simple user interface (UI) where players can input numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating this game:

Step 1: Set Up Unity Project
Open Unity and create a new 2D project.
Name your project (e.g., "CalculatorGame") and choose a save location.
Step 2: Design the User Interface (UI)
Create a Canvas:

Right-click in the Hierarchy panel.
Go to UI > Canvas. This will be the container for all UI elements.
Add Buttons for Digits (0-9):

Right-click on the Canvas in the Hierarchy.
Go to UI > Button to create a new button.
Rename the button to Button0 (or any other digit).
Duplicate the button (Ctrl + D) and rename it for other digits (Button1, Button2, etc.).
Arrange the buttons on the Canvas to resemble a calculator keypad.
Add Buttons for Operations (+, -, *, /):

Repeat the process to create buttons for each arithmetic operation.
Rename them appropriately (e.g., ButtonAdd, ButtonSubtract).
Add a Display Text:

Right-click on the Canvas.
Go to UI > Text to create a text element.
Rename it to DisplayText.
Set the alignment to Center and adjust the size and position.
Step 3: Write the Script
Create a New Script:

In the Project panel, right-click and choose Create > C# Script.
Name it CalculatorScript.
Edit the Script:

Double-click the script to open it in your code editor.
